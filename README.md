# Grav

Grav is a physics engine that allows you to:

- setup different sources of gravity
- let objects move within gravitational fields (even sources of gravity can move)

## Solar system

You can play with slovak version of solar system simulation in [grav.jar](https://github.com/Zaijo/grav/raw/master/grav.jar) by simply running `java -jar grav.jar`
